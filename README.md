# MySQL-Bamazon

This APP takes in database with a table of items and shows it to a customer for purchase.
Two promp questions are given, and user gives a response to an item and an amount of quantity wanted.
If the quantity is more than stock quantity, then the response is "Sorry Insufficient Quantity".
If the quantity is less than stock quantity, then the response gives total amount owed, and reduces the quantity amount of that item.

# Programs Used

For this app I used MySQL and node.js with a port and user to connect with the database.
The app uses MySQL to update and decrease the stock amount purchased against original stock quantity.
Also to select and display the items.
